## Criteria

---

This project fullfills all criteria. The code creates a README.md file. The applications asks all of the questions required and populates the users input in the appropriate sections. All the required dependencies were installed. Including the package.json and inquirer package. A video is included to help the user better understand how the application works. A series of screenshots and instructions are included to further help the user activate and use the application. The files that have the code in them have notes on how the code works. A sample read me is provided. A gitignore file is present to ignore modules. A package.json file is present to identify dependencies used.A text file has the hard code for this README in case it is written over. 

---

## Future

---

The first thing I would add to this application is an inquirer-date-prompt so that the user can add a time stamp of sorts to their README.md file.I would add more licenses. I would also format it similarly to how this README.md file is formatted. More space for images, gif's,video links, and other fields to atriculate the purpose and flexibitlity of the users project.
